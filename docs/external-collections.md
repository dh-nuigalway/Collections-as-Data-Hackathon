## Digital Public Library of America (DPLA)

**Their description**: 

DPLA connects people to the riches held within America’s libraries, archives, museums, and other cultural heritage institutions. All of the materials found through DPLA—photographs, books, maps, news footage, oral histories, personal letters, museum objects, artwork, government documents, and so much more—are free and immediately available in digital format. The cultural institutions participating in DPLA represent the richness and diversity of America itself, from the smallest local history museum to our nation’s largest cultural institutions. Our core work includes bringing new collections and partners into DPLA, building our technology, and managing projects that further our mission through curation, education, and community building.

## DHO: DRAPIER

A listing of Irish digital humanities projects, compiled by the (no longer operational) [Digital Humanities Observatory](http://dho.ie). 

**Their description**:
DRAPIer is an interactive database of Irish digital humanities projects. You can find projects of interest by searching for keywords or browsing by the facets listed on the right hand side of each page.

DRAPIer also documents the methods, formats and standards that are being used by the projects so that new projects can learn to use similar techniques, or so established projects can find related work in their field. The controlled vocabularies used by DRAPIer are based on those developed for ICT Guides and currently implemented by arts-humanities.net at the Centre for eResearch, King's College London. Refinement of the vocabularies is ongoing, and the DHO is actively contributing to this work.
