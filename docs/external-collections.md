The cultural institutions participating in DPLA represent the richness and diversity of America itself, from the smallest local history museum to our nation’s largest cultural institutions.

## DHO: DRAPIER

A listing of Irish digital humanities projects, compiled by the (no longer operational) [Digital Humanities Observatory](http://dho.ie). 

**Their description**:
_DRAPIer is an interactive database of Irish digital humanities projects. You can find projects of interest by searching for keywords or browsing by the facets listed on the right hand side of each page._

_DRAPIer also documents the methods, formats and standards that are being used by the projects so that new projects can learn to use similar techniques, or so established projects can find related work in their field. The controlled vocabularies used by DRAPIer are based on those developed for ICT Guides and currently implemented by arts-humanities.net at the Centre for eResearch, King's College London. Refinement of the vocabularies is ongoing, and the DHO is actively contributing to this work._

## Folger Digital Texts

**Their description:**

Our free, high-quality digital texts of Shakespeare's plays start with the basics: superb source texts, meticulously edited on the basis of current scholarship. The plays in Folger Digital Texts are taken from the Folger Shakespeare Library editions, completed in 2010 by editors Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine and published by Simon & Schuster.

To these texts, we've added sophisticated coding that works behind the scenes to make the plays easy to read, search, and index—and lays the groundwork for new features in the future. We've also used the same page numbers and layouts as in the Folger print editions, so it's simple to use the two together.
